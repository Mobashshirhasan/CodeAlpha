 I recently crafted a beginner-friendly Banking Application in Java, focusing on essential concepts like user input, loops, methods, and conditional statements. This hands-on project showcases my proficiency in core Java, as I implemented key banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. Excited to explore more coding opportunities and contribute to innovative projects!
